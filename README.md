# ManyDesigns Portofino 4 #

Portofino is a web application framework written in Java and extensible using Groovy, distributed under the LGPL open
source license. It is developed by ManyDesigns, based in Genoa, Italy (http://www.manydesigns.com).

The framework can be used to create good looking database-driven web applications. The creation process can include
automatic generation through a "wizard" tool that analyses the structure of a relational database, manual configuration
through a web-based administration interface, and customization through Groovy code. The result is a fully functional
application with a responsive web user interface, REST APIs, users and permissions, an email subsystem and much more,
which is easy to incrementally extend and customize, both graphically and in functionality (e.g., adding new buttons to
existing pages).

Portofino is based on popular and proven open source libraries such as Hibernate, Groovy, Apache Shiro, the Stripes web
framework, Twitter Bootstrap, Jersey JAX-RS.

The home of Portofino is http://portofino.manydesigns.com. There you can find the documentation, pointers to community
resources (forums, wiki, issue tracker), commercial support.
